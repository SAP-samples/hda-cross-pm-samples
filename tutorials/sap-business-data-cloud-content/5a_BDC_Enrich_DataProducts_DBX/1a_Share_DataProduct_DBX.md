Documentation on sharing SAP Business Data Cloud data products to SAP Databricks can be found [here](https://help.sap.com/docs/business-data-cloud/sap-databricks/creating-delta-sharing-catalog-from-data-product-in-sap-databricks).

An SAP data product is a refined data set based on data ingested from an SAP solution. SAP data products are created, delivered and managed by SAP and are the foundation for the SAP Business Data Cloud Intelligent Applications.

Installing the Intelligent Application also installs all the underlying data products. In the SAP Business Data Cloud Catalog, you can find all the data products that are available.

To make data products available for consumption in SAP Databricks, you can share data products from the SAP Business Data Cloud catalog to SAP Databricks.

In this lesson you will share the Company Code data product to SAP Databricks, which will be used in the following lessons to generate clustering company data based on common patterns and attributes.

- The SAP Databricks tenant has been provisioned in the SAP for Me.
