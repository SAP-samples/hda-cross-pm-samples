> [!NOTE]
> In Beta, the Replication Flows need to be scheduled again after a copy. For GA or after GA, it is planned to have an "ingestion space". This will be managed one per source by SAP. The copy feature will only apply to Insight Package spaces above. Therefore, there won't be duplicate data replication or the need to schedule Replication Flows in the copied space.
